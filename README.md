# Customer Feedback Automation with GenAI and LangChain

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to automate customer feedback responses using Generative AI. It combines:

- **DistilBERT**: For sentiment classification (positive/negative feedback)
- **TinyLlama**: For generating empathetic, polite, and actionable responses
- **LangChain**: To structure the pipeline and branch logic based on sentiment

This system can handle real-time feedback, generating tailored replies for both positive and negative comments, enhancing customer experience and engagement.

## Features
- Real-time sentiment detection
- Polite and context-aware response generation
- Separate handling for positive and negative feedback
- Easily extendable to other NLP tasks
